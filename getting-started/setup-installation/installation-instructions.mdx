# Installing the App

This guide walks you through acquiring and preparing the LearnXinYMinutesUnofficialAndroid app for both casual use via the Play Store and local development by cloning the source code. It covers installing the app on a device, cloning the repository for development, opening it in Android Studio, syncing dependencies, and preparing your environment for the first run.

## 1. Installing from the Play Store

If you want to simply use the Learn X in Y Minutes app without development, follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Play Store app on your Android device.
2. Search for **Learn X in Y Minutes** or directly visit the app page here:
   [Learn X in Y Minutes on Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ah.xiny3)
3. Tap **Install** and wait for the installation to complete.
4. Once installed, open the app to start exploring programming language cheat sheets on the go.

This method is the quickest way to access the app with no setup required beyond your device compatibility.

## 2. Cloning the Repository for Local Development

To explore, modify, or build the app yourself, you need to clone the GitHub repository and set up the development environment.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. Ensure you have Git installed. Confirm by running in your terminal:

   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

2. Navigate to your desired directory for the project.
3. Clone the repository using this command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/modelorona/LearnXinYMinutesUnofficalAndroidApp.git
   ```

4. Change into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd LearnXinYMinutesUnofficalAndroidApp
   ```

<Tip>
Make sure you have stable internet connectivity as the cloning process downloads the full history and project files.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Open the Project in Android Studio

1. Open **Android Studio** (preferably version 4.0 or later).
2. On the welcome screen, choose **Open an Existing Project**.
3. Browse to the cloned `LearnXinYMinutesUnofficalAndroidApp` folder and select it.
4. Android Studio will load the project and prompt to sync Gradle.

### Step 3: Sync Project and Download Dependencies

1. When prompted, click **Sync Now** to download dependencies and set up the environment.
2. Wait for Gradle to finish syncing successfully. This may take a few minutes on first run.

<Note>
If the sync fails, ensure you have an active internet connection and a compatible JDK (Java Development Kit) installed.
</Note>

### Step 4: Verify SDK and Build Tools

1. Open **File > Project Structure > SDK Location** and ensure the Android SDK path is correctly set.
2. Confirm you have installed Android SDK Platform 28 or higher and Build Tools matching or exceeding version 28.
3. If necessary, download these components via the SDK Manager inside Android Studio.

<Tip>
Using the latest stable Android Studio and SDK versions reduces compatibility issues.
</Tip>

## 3. Preparing Your Environment for the First Run

Before running the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Connect a physical Android device with developer mode enabled, or set up an Android Virtual Device (AVD) emulator.
2. Ensure USB debugging is enabled on your device if using a physical device.
3. Select your target device or emulator in the Android Studio toolbar.

---

## 4. Running Your First Build

1. In Android Studio, click the **Run** button (green play icon) or use the shortcut `Shift + F10`.
2. Wait for the build to complete and the app to deploy to your device or emulator.
3. Once installed, the app will launch automatically.

<Check>
A successful run should display the main language list screen where you can search and browse programming languages.
</Check>

## 5. Additional Tips and Best Practices

- **Keep Your Environment Updated:** Regularly update Android Studio and SDK tools.
- **Use Firebase Credentials:** The app depends on Firebase Firestore, which is already configured. No additional setup is required for default usage.
- **Build Variants:** The project currently supports a single build variant.

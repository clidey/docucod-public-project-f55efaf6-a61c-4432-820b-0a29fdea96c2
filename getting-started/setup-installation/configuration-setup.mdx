# Configuration & Firebase Setup

This guide walks you through the essential configuration steps to successfully connect and integrate the LearnXinYMinutesUnofficialAndroid app with Firebase when building or running the app locally. Correct environment setup, managing Firebase settings, and handling API keys are critical for enabling the app's full functionality, including dynamic data fetching and offline caching.

---

## 1. Overview of Configuration Needs

Before running the app locally, you must ensure your environment is properly set up to connect with Firebase Firestore — the backend service hosting the programming language reference data. The app depends on Firebase for real-time data synchronization, offline persistence, and user analytics.


## 2. Prerequisites for Firebase Setup

- **Firebase Project**: You need an existing Firebase project configured for this app. This includes Firebase Firestore enabled for data storage.
- **Google Services JSON**: Your local build requires the `google-services.json` file from your Firebase project, placed in the app’s `app/` directory.
- **Network Access**: Ensure your development environment has internet access on required ports (standard HTTPS ports) to communicate with Firebase services.

<Tip>
Not having the `google-services.json` file or using an incorrect Firebase configuration will cause the app to fail fetching language data.
</Tip>


## 3. Setting Up Firebase Configuration

### Step 1: Create or Access Your Firebase Project

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. Select an existing project or create a new one.
3. Make sure **Cloud Firestore** is enabled and configured with the collections expected by the app (notably the `languages` collection).

### Step 2: Obtain the `google-services.json` File

1. In your Firebase console, go to Project Settings > General.
2. Under Your Apps, click on your Android app. If none, register your Android app with the proper package name `com.ah.xiny3`.
3. Download the `google-services.json` configuration file.
4. Place this file in your app’s root folder at `/app/google-services.json`.

### Step 3: Verify Firebase Dependencies

Ensure the project’s Gradle files include Firebase Firestore dependencies (usually preconfigured in this project). You should see dependencies similar to:

```gradle
implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore:23.0.3'
implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics:20.0.0'
```

If missing, add these to your `app/build.gradle` file under `dependencies` and sync the project.

### Step 4: Enable Offline Persistence in Code

The app internally sets Firestore’s offline persistence with:

```java
FirebaseFirestoreSettings settings = new FirebaseFirestoreSettings.Builder()
    .setPersistenceEnabled(true)
    .build();
db.setFirestoreSettings(settings);
```

This allows the app to cache language data locally, supporting offline usage.


## 4. Managing Environment Variables and API Keys

The app does not require separate manual API key input from the user aside from the `google-services.json` file, which contains all necessary credentials securely.

<Tip>
Avoid hardcoding API keys elsewhere. Always use Firebase’s configuration management through `google-services.json` to maintain security best practices.
</Tip>


## 5. Validating Your Configuration

### Run the App Locally

1. Open Android Studio and load the project.
2. Verify the `google-services.json` is in place.
3. Build and run the app on an emulator or physical device.

### Expected Behavior

- The app fetches the list of languages from Firebase Firestore and displays them on the main screen.
- When selecting a language, it loads the corresponding HTML content retrieved from Firestore.
- Loading indicators disappear once data is fetched.

### Troubleshooting Connection Issues

If the app fails to retrieve data:

- Check that your Firebase project has the `languages` collection with documents containing `language` and `html` fields.
- Verify that your device/emulator has internet connectivity.
- Confirm that `google-services.json` is present and correctly linked.
- Look for errors in Android Studio’s Logcat related to Firebase or network failures.


## 6. Best Practices & Tips

- Keep Firebase SDK versions up to date in your project dependencies.
- Use Firebase console logging and analytics to monitor app usage and crashes.
- Always maintain security rules in Firestore restricting unauthorized data access.
- Regularly back up your Firestore data to prevent accidental data loss.
